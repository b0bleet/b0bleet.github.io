C language is very important to me, I use a lot of languages like Rust, Zig, C++, Go, Python. But every time I realize that none of them feels comfortable to me as C. Because I've been doing reverse engineering since my childhood, Iâ€™ve analyzed a lot of assembly instructions and pseudocode. At our startup, we started with Go from the early days, and I feel comfortable with it because of its easy syntax and simplicity. It feels similar to C for me. When I code in C, I mostly focus on problem-solving instead of thinking about language concepts like traits, classes or constraints. Maybe these concepts are important in some domains, but at some point I realized I'm a low-level guy. Why should I bother with these concepts? I enjoy working on real problems and making things faster or more efficient. If you're interested in learning C, I highly recommend starting with the following books:
- K&R C book
- Modern C by Jens Gustedt
